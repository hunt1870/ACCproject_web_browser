python programs next ? ? prev python unit testing in this tutorial, we will implement unit testing using the python. unit testing using python is a huge topic itself, but we will cover a few essential concepts. what is the python unittest? unit testing is a technique in which particular module is tested to check by developer himself whether there are any errors. the primary focus of unit testing is test an individual unit of system to analyze, detect, and fix the errors. python provides the unittest module to test the unit of source code. the unittest plays an essential role when we are writing the huge code, and it provides the facility to check whether the output is correct or not. normally, we print the value and match it with the reference output or check the output manually. this process takes lots of time. to overcome this problem, python introduces the unittest module. we can also check the application's performance by using it. we will learn how to create a basic test, finds the bugs, and execute it before the code delivers to the users. testing the code we can test our code using many ways. in this section, we will learn the basic steps towards advanced methods. automate vs. manual testing manual testing has another form, which is known as exploratory testing. it is a testing which is done without any plan. to do the manual testing, we need to prepare a list of the application; we enter the different inputs and wait for the expected output. every time we give the inputs or change the code, we need to go through every single feature of the list and check it. it is the most common way of testing and it is also time-consuming process. on the other hand, the automated testing executes the code according to our code plan which means it runs a part of the code that we want to test, the order in which we want to test them by a script instead of a human. python offers a set of tools and libraries which help us to create automated tests for the application. unit tests vs. integration tests suppose we want to check the lights of the car and how we might test them. we would turn on the light and go outside the car or ask the friend that lights are on or not. the turning on the light will consider as the test step, and go outside or ask to the friend will know as the test assertion. in the integration testing, we can test multiple components at once. these components can be anything in our code, such as functions, classes and module that we have written. but there is a limitation of the integration testing; what if an integration test doesn't give the expected result. in this situation, it will be very hard to recognize which part of the system is falling. let's take the previous example; if the light didn't turn on, the battery might be dead, blub is broken, car's computer have failed. that's why we consider unit testing to get to know the exact problem in the tested code. unit testing is a smaller test, it checks a single component that it is working in right way or not. using the unit test, we can separate what necessities to be fixed in our system. we have seen the two types of testing so far; an integration test checks the multiple components; where unit test checks small component in or application. let's understand the following example. we apply the unit testing python built-in function sum() against the known output. we check that the sum() of the number (2, 3, 5) equals 10. 
assert sum([ 2, 3, 5]) == 10, "should be 10"
 above line will return the right result because values are correct. if we pass the wrong arguments it will return the assertion error. for example - 
assert sum([1, 3, 5]) == 10, "should be 10"
traceback (most recent call last):
  file "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
assertionerror: should be 10
 we can put the above code into the file and execute it again at the command line. 
def test_sum():
    assert sum([2, 3, 5]) == 10, "it should be 10"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sum()
    print("everything passed")
 output: $ python sum.py
everything is correct
 in the following example, we will pass the tuple for testing purpose. create a new file named test_sum2.py. example - 2: 
def test_sum2():
    assert sum([2, 3, 5]) == 10, "it should be 10"

def test_sum_tuple():
    assert sum((1, 3, 5)) == 10, "it should be 10"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sum2()
    test_sum_tuple()
    print("everything is correct")
 output: everything is correct
traceback (most recent call last):
  file "<string>", line 13, in <module>
file "<string>", line 9, in test_sum_tuple
assertionerror: it should be 10
 explanation - in the above code, we have passed the wrong input to the test_sum_tuple(). the output is dissimilar to the predicted result. the above method is good but what if there are multiple errors. python interpreter would give an error immediately if the first error is encountered. to remove this problem, we use the test runners. test runner applications specially designed for testing the output, running test and give tools for fixing and diagnosing tests and applications. choosing a test runner python contains many test runners. the most popular build-in python library is called unittest. the unittest is portable to the other frameworks. consider the following three top most test runners. unittest nose or nose2 pytest we can choose any of them according to our requirements. let's have a brief introduction. unittest the unittest is built into the python standard library since 2.1. the best thing about the unittest, it comes with both a test framework and a test runner. there are few requirements of the unittest to write and execute the code. the code must be written using the classes and functions. the sequence of distinct assertion methods in the testcase class apart from the built-in asserts statements. let's implement the above example using the unittest case. example - 
import unittest
class testingsum(unittest.testcase):

    def test_sum(self):
        self.assertequal(sum([2, 3, 5]), 10, "it should be 10")
    def test_sum_tuple(self):
        self.assertequal(sum((1, 3, 5)), 10, "it should be 10")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
 output: .f
-
fail: test_sum_tuple (__main__.testingsum)
--
traceback (most recent call last):
  file "<string>", line 11, in test_sum_tuple

    sys.exit(not self.result.wassuccessful())
systemexit: true
 as we can see in the output, it shows the dot(.) for the successful execution and f for the one failure. nose sometimes, we need to write hundreds or thousands of test lines for application; it becomes so difficult to understand. the nose test runner can be a suitable replacement of the unittest test runners because it is compatible with any tests writing using the unittest framework. there are two types of nose - nose and nose2. we recommend using nose2 because it is a latest version. working with the nose2, we need to install it using the following command. 
pip install nose2
 run the following command in the terminal to test the code using nose2. 
python -m nose2
 the output is as follows. fail: test_sum_tuple (__main__.testsum)
--

--

failed (failures=1)
 the nose2 provides many command line flags for filtering the test. you can learn more from its official documentation. pytest the pytest test runner supports the execution of unittest test cases. the actual benefit of the pytest is to writing pytest test cases. the pytest test cases are generally sequence of methods in the python file starting. the pytest provides the following benefits - it supports the built-in assert statement instead of using a special assert*() methods. it also provides support for cleaning for test cases. it can rerun from the last cases. it has an ecosystem of hundreds of plugin to extend the functionality. let's understand the following example. example - 
def test_sum():
    assert sum([2, 3, 5]) == 10, "it should be 10"
def test_sum_tuple():
    assert sum((1, 2, 5)) == 10, "it should be 10"
 writing the first test here we will apply all the concepts that we have learned in earlier section. first, we need to create a file name test.py or anything. then make inputs and execute the code being tested, capturing the output. after successfully run the code, match the output with an expected result. first, we create the file my_sum file and write code in it. 
def sum(arg):
    total = 0
    for val in arg:
        total += val
    return total
 we initialized the total variable which iterates over all the values in arg. now, we create a file name test.py with the following code. example - 
import unittest

from my_sum import sum


class checksum(unittest.testcase):
    def test_list_int(self):

        data = [1, 2, 3]
        result = sum(data)
        self.assertequal(result, 6)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
 output: .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ran 1 test in 0.000s

ok
 explanation: in the above code, we imported sum() from the my_sum package that we created. we have defined the checkclass, which inherits from unittest.testcase. there is a test methods - .test_list_int(), to test the integer. after running the code, it returns dot(.) which means there is no error in the code. let's understand another example. example - 2 
class person:
    name1 = []

    def set_name(self, user_name):
        self.name1.append(user_name)
        return len(self.name1) - 1

    def get_name(self, user_id):
        if user_id >= len(self.name1):
            return ' no such user find'
        else:
            return self.name1[user_id]


if __name__ == '__main__':
    person = person()
    print('peter decosta has been added with id ', person.set_name('peter'))
    print('the user associated with id 0 is ', person.get_name(0))
 output: peter decosta has been added with id 0
the user associated with id 0 is peter
 python basic functions and unit test output the unittest module produces three possible outcomes. below are the potential outcomes. ok - if all tests are passed, it will return ok. failure - it will raise an assertionerror exception, if any of tests is failed. error - if any errors occur instead of assertion error. let's see the following basic functions. method description .assertequal(a, b) a == b .asserttrue(x) bool(x) is true .assertfalse(x) bool(x) is false .assertis(a, b) a is b .assertisnone(x) x is none .assertin(a, b) a in b .assertisinstance(a, b) isinstance(a, b) .assertnotin(a, b) a not in b .assertnotisinstance(a,b) not isinstance(a, b) .assertisnot(a, b) a is not b python unit test example

 advance testing scenario we must follow the given step while creating test for the application. generate necessary input execute the code, taking the output. match the output with an expected result. creating inputs such as static value for the input like a string or numbers is a slightly complex task. sometimes, we need to create an instance of a class or a context. the input data that we create is known as a fixture. we can reuse fixtures in our application. when we run the code repeatedly and pass the different values each time and expecting the same result, this process is known as parameterization. handling expected failures in the earlier example, we pass the integer number to test sum(); what happens if we pass the bad value, such as a single integer or a string? the sum() will throw an error as expected. it would happen due to failed test. we can use the .assertraises() to handle the expected errors. it is used inside with statement. let's understand the following example. example - 
import unittest
from my_sum import sum

class checksum(unittest.testcase):
    def test_list_int(self):

       #  test that it can sum a list of integers

 python unittest skip test we can skip an individual test method or testcase using the skip test technique. the fail will not count as a failure in testresult. consider the following example to skip the method unconditionally. example - 
import unittest

def add(x,y):
      c = x + y
      return c

class simpletest(unittest.testcase):
   @unittest.skip("the example skipping method")
   def testadd1(self):

 explanation: as we can see in the output, the conditions b == 0 and a>b is true so the test_mul() method has skipped. on the other hand, test_mul has been marked as an expected failure. conclusion we have discussed the all-important concept related to python unit testing. as a beginner, we need to write the smart, maintainable methods to validate our code. once we get a decent command over the python unit test, we can switch to other frameworks such as the pytest and leverage more advanced features. next topicpython forensics and virtualization ? prev next ? for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me ? copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
