python programs next ? ? prev merge sort in python merge sort is similar to the quick sort algorithm as works on the concept of divide and conquer. it is one of the most popular and efficient sorting algorithm. it is the best example for divide and conquer category of algorithms. it divides the given list in the two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. we define the merge() function used to merging two halves. the sub lists are divided again and again into halves until we get the only one element each. then we combine the pair of one element lists into two element lists, sorting them in the process. the sorted two element pairs is merged into the four element lists, and so on until we get the sorted list. merge sort concept let's see the following merge sort diagram. we have divided the given list in the two halves. the list couldn't be divided in equal parts it doesn't matter at all. merge sort can be implement using the two ways - top-down approach and bottom-up approach. we use the top down approach in the above example, which is merge sort most often used. the bottom-up approach provides the more optimization which we will define later. the main part of the algorithm is that how we combine the two sorted sublists. let's merge the two sorted merge list. a : [2, 4, 7, 8] b : [1, 3, 11] sorted : empty first, we observe the first element of both lists. we find the b's first element is smaller, so we add this in our sorted list and move forward in the b list. a : [2, 4, 7, 8] b : [1, 3, 11] sorted : 1 now we look at the next pair of elements 2 and 3. 2 is smaller so we add it into our sorted list and move forward to the list. a : [2, 4, 7, 8] b : [1, 3, 11] sorted : 1 continue this process and we end up with the sorted list of {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11}. there can be two special cases. what if both sublists have same elements - in such case, we can move either one sublist and add the element to the sorted list. technically, we can move forward in both sublist and add the elements to the sorted list. we have no element left in one sublist. when we run out the in a sublist simply add the element of the second one after the other. we should remember that we can sort the element in the any order. we sort the given list in ascending order but we can easily sort in descending order. implementation the merge sort algorithm is implemented by suing the top-down approach. it can be look slightly difficult, so we will elaborate each step in details. here, we will implement this algorithm on two types of collections - integer element's list (typically used to introduce sorting) and a custom objects (a more practical and realistic scenario). sorting array the main concept of algorithm is to divide (sub)list into halves and sort them recursively. we continue the process until we end up lists that have only one element. let's understand the following function for division - 
def merge_sort(array, left_index, right_index): 
       if left_index >= right_index: 
                 return middle = (left_index + right_index)//2 
       merge_sort(array, left_index, middle) 
       merge_sort(array, middle + 1, right_index) 
       merge(array, left_index, right_index, middle) 
 our primary focus to divide the list into subparts before the sorting happen. we need to get the integer value so we use the // operator for our indices. let's understand the above procedure by following steps. first step is to create copies of lists. the first list contains the lists from [left_index,...,middle] and the second from [middle+1,?,right_index]. we traverse both copies of list by using the pointer, select the smaller value of the two values and add them to the sorted list. once we add the element to the list and we move forward in the sorted list regardless. add the remaining elements in the other copy to the sorted array. let's implement the merge sort in python program. python program 
# funtion to divide the lists in the two sublists
def merge_sort(list1, left_index, right_index):
    if left_index >= right_index:
        return

    middle = (left_index + right_index)//2
    merge_sort(list1, left_index, middle)
    merge_sort(list1, middle + 1, right_index)
    merge(list1, left_index, right_index, middle)


    # defining a function for merge the list
def merge(list1, left_index, right_index, middle):


   # creating subparts of a lists
    left_sublist = list1[left_index:middle + 1]
    right_sublist = list1[middle+1:right_index+1]

    # initial values for variables that we use to keep
    # track of where we are in each list1
    left_sublist_index = 0
    right_sublist_index = 0
    sorted_index = left_index

    # traverse both copies until we get run out one element
    while left_sublist_index < len(left_sublist) and right_sublist_index < len(right_sublist):

        # if our left_sublist has the smaller element, put it in the sorted
        # part and then move forward in left_sublist (by increasing the pointer)
        if left_sublist[left_sublist_index] <= right_sublist[right_sublist_index]:
            list1[sorted_index] = left_sublist[left_sublist_index]
            left_sublist_index = left_sublist_index + 1
        # otherwise add it into the right sublist
        else:
            list1[sorted_index] = right_sublist[right_sublist_index]
            right_sublist_index = right_sublist_index + 1


        # move forward in the sorted part
        sorted_index = sorted_index + 1

     
    # we will go through the remaining elements and add them
    while left_sublist_index < len(left_sublist):
        list1[sorted_index] = left_sublist[left_sublist_index]
        left_sublist_index = left_sublist_index + 1
        sorted_index = sorted_index + 1

    while right_sublist_index < len(right_sublist):
        list1[sorted_index] = right_sublist[right_sublist_index]
        right_sublist_index = right_sublist_index + 1
        sorted_index = sorted_index + 1

list1 = [44, 65, 2, 3, 58, 14, 57, 23, 10, 1, 7, 74, 48]
merge_sort(list1, 0, len(list1) -1)
print(list1)
 output: [1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 23, 44, 48, 57, 58, 65, 74]
 sorting custom objects we can also sort the custom objects by using the python class. this algorithm is almost similar to the above but we need to make it more versatile and pass the comparison function. we will create a custom class, car and add a few fields to it. we make few changes in the below algorithm to make it more versatile. we can do this by using the lambda functions. let's understand the following example. python program 
class car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def __str__(self):
        return str.format("make: {}, model: {}, year: {}", self.make, self.model, self.year)

def merge(list1, l, r, m, comp_fun):
    left_copy = list1[l:m + 1]
    r_sublist = list1[m+1:r+1]

    left_copy_index = 0
    r_sublist_index = 0
    sorted_index = l

    while left_copy_index < len(left_copy) and r_sublist_index < len(r_sublist):

        # we use the comp_fun instead of a simple comparison operator
        if comp_fun(left_copy[left_copy_index], r_sublist[r_sublist_index]):
            list1[sorted_index] = left_copy[left_copy_index]
            left_copy_index = left_copy_index + 1
        else:
            list1[sorted_index] = r_sublist[r_sublist_index]
            r_sublist_index = r_sublist_index + 1

        sorted_index = sorted_index + 1

    while left_copy_index < len(left_copy):
        list1[sorted_index] = left_copy[left_copy_index]
        left_copy_index = left_copy_index + 1
        sorted_index = sorted_index + 1

    while r_sublist_index < len(r_sublist):
        list1[sorted_index] = r_sublist[r_sublist_index]
        r_sublist_index = r_sublist_index + 1
        sorted_index = sorted_index + 1


def merge_sort(list1, l, r, comp_fun):
    if l >= r:
        return

    m = (l + r)//2
    merge_sort(list1, l, m, comp_fun)
    merge_sort(list1, m + 1, r, comp_fun)
    merge(list1, l, r, m, comp_fun)

car1 = car("renault", "33 duster", 2001)
car2 = car("maruti", "maruti suzuki dzire", 2015)
car3 = car("tata motor", "jaguar", 2004)
car4 = car("cadillac", "seville sedan", 1995)

list1 = [car1, car2, car3, car4]

merge_sort(list1, 0, len(list1) -1, lambda cara, carb: cara.year < carb.year)

print("cars sorted by year:")
for car in list1:
    print(car)

print()
merge_sort(list1, 0, len(list1) -1, lambda cara, carb: cara.make < carb.make)
print("cars sorted by make:")
for car in list1:
    print(car)
 output: cars sorted by year:

 optimization we can improve the performance of the merge sort algorithm. first let's understand the difference between the top-down and bottom-up merge sort. the bottom-up approach sorts the elements of adjacent lists iteratively where the top-down approach breaks down the lists into the two halves. the given list is [10, 4, 2, 12, 1, 3], instead of breaking it down into [10], [4], [2], [12], [1], [3] - we divides into the sublists which may already sorted: [10, 4], [2], [1, 12], [3] and now are ready to sort them. merge sort is inefficient algorithm in both time and space for the smaller sublists. so insertion sort is more efficient algorithm than the merge sort for the smaller sublists. conclusion merge sort is popular and efficient algorithm. it is more efficient algorithm for the large lists. it doesn't depend on the any unfortunate decisions that lead to bad runtimes. there is one major demerit in the merge sort. it uses the additional memory that is used to store the temporary copies of lists before merging them. however merge sort is widely used in the software. its performance is fast and produces the excellent result. we have discussed the merge sort concept in brief and implement it both on simple integer list and on custom objects via a lambda function used for comparison. next topicpython matrix ? prev next ? for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me ? copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
