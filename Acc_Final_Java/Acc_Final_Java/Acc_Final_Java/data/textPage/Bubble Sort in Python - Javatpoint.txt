intuitive. it can be easy to implement into the code, which is much beneficial for beginner software developers. but it is the worst algorithm for sorting the elements in every except because it checks every time the array is sorted or not. let's understand the concepts of the bubble sort. concept of bubble sort the bubble sort uses a straightforward logic that works by repeating swapping the adjacent elements if they are not in the right order. it compares one pair at a time and swaps if the first element is greater than the second element; otherwise, move further to the next pair of elements for comparison. let's understand it by an example - example - we are creating a list of element, which stores the integer numbers list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2] here the algorithm sort the elements - first iteration [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2] it compares the first two elements and here 5>3 then swap with each other. now we get new list is - [3, 5, 8, 6, 7, 2] in second comparison, 5 < 8 then swapping happen - [3, 5, 8, 6, 7, 2] in third comparison, 8>6 then swap - [3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 2] in fourth comparison, 8>7 then swap - [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2] in fifth comparison, 8>2 then swap- [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] here the first iteration is complete and we get the largest element at the end. now we need to the len(list1) - 1 second iteration [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] - > [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] here, 3<5 then no swap taken place [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] - > [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] here, 5<6 then no swap taken place [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] - > [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] here, 6<7 then no swap taken place [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] - > [3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8] here 7>2 then swap their position. now [3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8] - > [3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8] here 7<8 then no swap taken place. third iteration [3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8] - > [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] here, 3<5 then no swap taken place [3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8] - > [3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8] here, 5<6 then no swap taken place [3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8] - > [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] here, 6<2 then swap their positions [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] - > [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] here 6<7 then no swap taken place. now [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] - > [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] here 7<8 then swap their position. it will iterate until the list is sorted. fourth iteration - [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] - > [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] [3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] - > [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] - > [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] - > [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] - > [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] fifth iteration [3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] - > [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] check the each element and as we can see that our list is sorted using the bubble sort technique. implementation in python code we have already described the technique of bubble sort. now, we will implement the logic in the python code. program 
# creating a bubble sort function
def bubble_sort(list1):
    # outer loop for traverse the entire list
    for i in range(0,len(list1)-1):
        for j in range(len(list1)-1):
            if(list1[j]>list1[j+1]):
                temp = list1[j]
                list1[j] = list1[j+1]
                list1[j+1] = temp
    return list1

list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
print("the unsorted list is: ", list1)
# calling the bubble sort function
print("the sorted list is: ", bubble_sort(list1))
 output: the unsorted list is:  [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
the sorted list is:  [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
 explanation: in the above code, we have defined a bubble_sort() function which takes list1 as an argument. inside the function, we have defined two for loop - first for loop iterates the complete list and the second for loop iterates the list and the compare the two elements in every outer loop iterations. the for loop will be terminated when it reaches at the end. we have defined the condition in the inner for loop; if a first index value is greater than the second index value, swap their positions with each other. we called the function and passed a list; it iterated and returned the sorted list. without using a temp variable we can also swap the elements without using the temp variable. python has a very unique syntax. we can use the following lines of code. example - 
def bubble_sort(list1):
    # outer loop for traverse the entire list
    for i in range(0,len(list1)-1):
        for j in range(len(list1)-1):
            if(list1[j]>list1[j+1]): 
                # here we are not using temp variable
                list1[j],list1[j+1] = list1[j+1], list1[j]
    return list1

list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
print("the unsorted list is: ", list1)
# calling the bubble sort function
print("the sorted list is: ", bubble_sort(list1))
 output: the unsorted list is:  [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
the sorted list is:  [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
 optimization of python code implementation we can optimize the above code using the two techniques. the swaps are not done; it means list is sorted. in the previous technique - the previous technique will evaluate the complete list though it doesn't seem necessary to do. we can prevent the unnecessary evaluation using the boolean flag and checks if any swaps were made in the previous section. example - 
def bubble_sort(list1):
   # we can stop the iteration once the swap has done
    has_swapped = true

    while(has_swapped):
        has_swapped = false
        for i in range(len(list1) - 1):
            if list1[i] > list1[i+1]:
                # swap
                list1[i], list1[i+1] = list1[i+1], list1[i]
                has_swapped = true
    return list1


list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
print("the unsorted list is: ", list1)
# calling the bubble sort function
print("the sorted list is: ", bubble_sort(list1))
 output: the unsorted list is:  [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
the sorted list is:  [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
 in the second technique, we consider the fact that the iteration is ended when the largest element of the list end up at the end of the list. the first time, we pass the largest element at the end position using the n position. the second time, we pass through the n-1 position, the second largest element. in each consecutive iteration, we can compare at one less element than before. more accurately, in the k-th iteration, only need to compare at the first n - k + 1 elements: example - 
def bubble_sort(list1):
    has_swapped = true

    total_iteration = 0

    while(has_swapped):
        has_swapped = false
        for i in range(len(list1) - total_iteration - 1):
            if list1[i] > list1[i+1]:
                # swap
                list1[i], list1[i+1] = list1[i+1], list1[i]
                has_swapped = true
        total_iteration += 1
    print("the number of iteraton: ",total_iteration)
    return list1

list1 = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
print("the unsorted list is: ", list1)
# calling the bubble sort funtion
print("the sorted list is: ", bubble_sort(list1))
 output: the unsorted list is:  [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]
the number of iteraton:  6
the sorted list is:  [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
 time comparison let's see the time comparison between the above code snippets. 
unoptimized bubble sort takes: 0.0106407
optimize bubble sort takes: 0.0078251
bubble sort with a boolean flag and shortened list takes: 0.0075207 
 all techniques are useful for the fewer elements, but if the list consists of many elements, then the second optimize technique make a huge difference. next topiclogging in python ? prev next ? for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected] help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me ? copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
