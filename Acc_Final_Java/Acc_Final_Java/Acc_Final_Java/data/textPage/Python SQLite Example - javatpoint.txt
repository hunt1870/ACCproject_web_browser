 .databases
 note: to connect sqlite with python, you do not need to install the connection module separately because its being shipped by default along with python version 2.5.x onwards. sqlite with python create a python file "connect.py", having the following code: 
#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')

print "opened database successfully";
 execute the following statement on command prompt: 
python connect.py
 now connection is created with the javatpoint database. now you can create a table. create a table create a table "employees" within the database "javatpoint". create a python file "createtable.py", having the following code: 
#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')
print "opened database successfully";

conn.execute('''create table employees
       (id int primary key     not null,
       name           text    not null,
       age            int     not null,
       address        char(50),
       salary         real);''')
print "table created successfully";

conn.close()
 execute the following statement on command prompt: 
python createtable.py
 a table "employees" is created in the "javatpoint" database. insert records insert some records in "employees" table. create a python file "connection.py", having the following code: 
#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')
print "opened database successfully";

conn.execute("insert into employees (id,name,age,address,salary) \
      values (1, 'ajeet', 27, 'delhi', 20000.00 )");

conn.execute("insert into employees (id,name,age,address,salary) \
      values (2, 'allen', 22, 'london', 25000.00 )");

conn.execute("insert into employees (id,name,age,address,salary) \
      values (3, 'mark', 29, 'ca', 200000.00 )");

conn.execute("insert into employees (id,name,age,address,salary) \
      values (4, 'kanchan', 22, 'ghaziabad ', 65000.00 )");

conn.commit()
print "records inserted successfully";
conn.close()
 execute the following statement on command prompt: 
python connection.py
 records are inserted successfully. select records now you can fetch and display your records from the table "employees" by using select statement. create a python file "select.py", having the following code: 
#!/usr/bin/python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('javatpoint.db')

data = conn.execute("select * from employees");

for row in data:
   print "id = ", row[0]
   print "name = ", row[1]
   print "address = ", row[2]
   print "salary = ", row[3], "\n"

conn.close();
