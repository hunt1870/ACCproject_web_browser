and we can perform a variety of operations on them. in this tutorial, we will learn one more interesting task that can be accomplished using strings in python. here we will see how we can remove multiple characters from it. we have listed below the methods that we will learn to meet our objective. using nested replace() using translate() & maketrans() using subn() using sub() using nested replace() in the program given below, we will see how replace() is used to remove multiple characters from the string. 
#initializing the string
string_val = 'learnpythonlearn'
#displaying the string value
print("the initialized string is ", string_val)
#using nested replace()
res_str = string_val.replace('l', '%temp%').replace('l', 'e').replace('%temp%', 'e')
#printing the resultant string
print ("the string after replacing the characters is ", res_str)
 output: the initialized string is  learnpythonlearn
the string after replacing the characters is  eearnpythoneearn
 explanation- in the first step, we have initialized the string whose characters we would like to replace. after this, we have displayed the original string so that we can easily understand the difference between this and the expected output. now we have used replace() and specified the characters that we wish to remove or change. on executing the program, the desired output is displayed. in the second program, we will see how translate() and maketrans() can be used to do the same. the users must keep this thing in their mind that it only works in python 2. using translate() and maketrans() the following program shows how it can be done. 
import string
#initializing the string
string_val='learnpythonlearn'
#displaying the string value
print("the initialized string is ",string_val)
#using translate() & maketrans()
res_str=string_val.translate(string.maketrans('le','el'))
#printing the resultant string
print("the string after replacing the characters is ",res_str)
 output: the initialized string is  learnpythonlearn
the string after replacing the characters is  eearnpythoneearn
 explanation- in the first step, we have initialized the string whose characters we would like to replace. after this, we have displayed the original string so that we can easily understand the difference between this and the expected output. now we have used replace() and specified the characters that we wish to remove or change. on executing the program, the desired output is displayed. now we will discuss how re.subn() can become an aid for this. the subn() returns a new string with the total number of replacements. using re.subn() the program given below shows how it can be done. 
#importing the re module
import re
#initializing the string value
string_val = "to get the result 100, we can multiply 10 by 10"
#defining the function
def pass_str(string_val):
    string_val, n = re.subn('[0-9]', 'a', string_val)
    print (string_val)
#displaying the resultant value
pass_str(string_val)
 output: to get the result aaa, we can multiply aa by aa
 explanation- in the first step, we have imported the re module that will help us to use the required functions. after this, we have initialized the string whose characters we would like to replace or remove. the next step is to define a function that takes the string value as its parameter. in the function definition, we have used subn() that takes three parameters. the first parameter is the pattern that we wish to replace, the second is with what element or number we want to replace it and the third is the string. finally, the print statement at the end shows that the processed string is displayed. we have passed this string at the end so that we get the expected output. in the last program, we will do the same thing using sub() using re.sub() the following program illustrates how it can be done- 
#importing the re module
import re
#initializing the string value
string_val = "to get the result 100, we can multiply 10 by 10"
#defining the function
def pass_str(string_val):
    string_val = re.sub('[0-9]', 'z', string_val)
    print(string_val)
#displaying the resultant value
pass_str(string_val)
 output: to get the result zzz, we can multiply zz by zz
 explanation- in the first step, we have imported the re module that will help us to use the required functions. after this, we have initialized the string whose characters we would like to replace or remove. the next step is to define a function that takes the string value as its parameter. in the function definition, we have used sub() that takes three parameters. the first parameter is the pattern that we wish to replace, the second is with what element or number we want to replace it and the third is the string. finally, the print statement at the end shows that the processed string is displayed. we have passed this string at the end so that we get the expected output. conclusion in this tutorial, we learned how we can remove multiple characters from a string using python. next topicshuffle in python ? prev next ? for videos join our youtube channel: join now feedback send your feedback to [email protected]avatpoint.com help others, please share learn latest tutorials splunk spss swagger transact-sql tumblr reactjs regex reinforcement learning r programming rxjs react native python design patterns python pillow python turtle keras preparation aptitude reasoning verbal ability interview questions company questions trending technologies artificial intelligence aws selenium cloud computing hadoop reactjs data science angular 7 blockchain git machine learning devops b.tech / mca dbms data structures daa operating system computer network compiler design computer organization discrete mathematics ethical hacking computer graphics software engineering web technology cyber security automata c programming c++ java .net python programs control system data mining data warehouse javatpoint services javatpoint offers too many high quality services. mail us on [email protected], to get more information about given services. website designing website development java development php development wordpress graphic designing logo digital marketing on page and off page seo ppc content development corporate training classroom and online training data entry training for college campus javatpoint offers college campus training on core java, advance java, .net, android, hadoop, php, web technology and python. please mail your requirement at [email protected] duration: 1 week to 2 week like/subscribe us for latest updates or newsletter learn tutorialslearn javalearn data structureslearn c programminglearn c++ tutoriallearn c# tutoriallearn php tutoriallearn html tutoriallearn javascript tutoriallearn jquery tutoriallearn spring tutorial our websitesjavatpoint.comhindi100.comlyricsia.comquoteperson.comjobandplacement.com our services website development android development website designing digital marketing summer training industrial training college campus training contact address: g-13, 2nd floor, sec-3 noida, up, 201301, india contact no: 0120-4256464, 9990449935contact us subscribe us privacy policysitemap about me ? copyright 2011-2021 www.javatpoint.com. all rights reserved. developed by javatpoint.
