[rafiki hits simba on the head with his stick] adult simba: ow! jeez, what was that for? rafiki: it doesn't matter. it's in the past. [laughs] adult simba: yeah, but it still hurts. rafiki: oh yes, the past can hurt. but from the way i see it, you can either run from it, or... learn from it. [swings his stick again at simba, who ducks out of the way] rafiki: ha. you see? so what are you going to do? adult simba: first, i'm gonna take your stick. [simba snatches rafiki's stick and throws it and rafiki runs to grab it] rafiki: no, no, no, no, not the stick! hey, where you going? adult simba: i'm going back! rafiki: good! go on! get out of here! [rafiki begins laughing and screeching loudly] crazy credits there are no opening credits. alternate versions this film was re-released in imax and other large format theaters on december 25, 2002. the following changes were made to the film for this release: -this movie opens with "the lion king: special edition" title card, following the walt disney pictures logo. -the pouncing lesson scene was replaced with an all-new song, "morning report", originally from the stage show. -the animation of crocodiles in the "i just can't wait to be king" sequence was completely re-done. -the animation in some of the scenes went back through the clean-up animation department a second time, to correct problems such as wavering lines and missing details, which, while not very noticeable during a traditional 35mm showing of the film, would have been discomforting on a much large imax screen. small details, such as the characters who had faces that were too small to be seen in the original had faces, were also added. -the waterfalls in the "can you feel the love tonight" sequence were enhanced. -the 2003 platinum edition release contains the different end credits from the 2002 imax/special edition re-release. connections edited into the lion king: a musical journey with elton john (1994) soundtracks circle of life (1994) music by elton john (uncredited) lyrics by tim rice (uncredited) arranged and produced by hans zimmer performed by carmen twillie african vocals performed by lebo m. background singer: rodney saulsberry (uncredited) chorus: maxi anderson, terry bradford, johnny britt, baby cele, lucky cele, rick charles, gugwana dlamini, kevin dorsey, wendy fraser, linda gcwensa, clydene jackson (as clydene jackson), matoab'sane jali, luyanda jezile, bob joyce, faith kekana, sphiwe khanyile, faca khulu, stella khumalo, skhumbuzo kubheka, thembi kubheka, ron kunene, james langa, edie lehmann boddicker, rick logan, tsidi manye, khanyo maphumulo, abner a. mariri, myrna matthews, batho mhlongo, vusi mhlongo, nonhlanhla mkhize, thembi mtshali, bheki ndlovu, nandi ndlovu, bongani ngcobo, nini nkosi, bobbi page, phindile, rick riso, philile seme, alfie silas, happy skhakhane, kipizane skweyiya, sindisiwe sokhela, susie stevens-logan (as susan d. stevens), khuluiwe sithole (as khuluiwe s'thole), thandazile, carmen twillie, sam vamplew, julia waters, luther waters (as luther n. waters), maxine waters willard (as maxine waters), oren waters, john j west, yvonne williams, terry young, zolile zulu user reviews1.1k review top review 10/10 the best animated film i have ever seen the lion king is a great film. along with a great story (inspired by william shakespeare's hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children). like responsibility and honor. i rank this animated film among the great films i have ever seen. it was part of my childhood and it is a film experience i will never forget. and hopefully, you won't either. a++ helpful?428 71 quinoa1984 jan 1, 2000 faq10 why was nala away from pride rock when she tried to hunt down first pumbaa, then timon? are timon and pumbaa inspired by ren and stimpy in any way? the duo seem like toned down versions, with timon having some of ren's arrogance and pumbaa being as nice but flatulent as stimpy. is 'the lion king' based on a book?
