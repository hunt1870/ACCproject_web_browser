incentives to contribute to open-content publishing", discussed the possible motivations of wikipedia contributors. it applied latour and woolgar's concept of the cycle of credit to wikipedia contributors, suggesting that the reason that people write for wikipedia is to gain recognition within the community.[14] oded nov, in his 2007 paper "what motivates wikipedians", related the motivations of volunteers in general to the motivations of people who contribute to wikipedia.[15] nov carried out a survey using the six motivations of volunteers, identified in an earlier paper.[16] the six motivations he used were: values ? expressing values to do with altruism and helping others social ? engaging with friends, taking part in activities viewed favourably by others understanding ? expanding knowledge through activities career ? gaining work experience and skills protective ? e.g., reducing guilt over personal privilege enhancement ? demonstrating knowledge to others to these six motivations he also added: ideology ? expressing support for what is perceived to be the underlying ideology of the activity (e.g., the belief that knowledge should be free) fun ? enjoying the activity the survey found that the most commonly indicated motives were "fun", "ideology", and "values", whereas the least frequently indicated motives were "career", "social", and "protective".[15] the wikimedia foundation has carried out some surveys of wikipedia contributors and users. in 2008, the wikimedia foundation, alongside the collaborative creativity group at unu-merit, launched a survey of readers and editors of wikipedia.[17] the results of the survey were published two years later on 24 march 2010.[18] the wikimedia foundation began a process in 2011 of semi-annual surveys in order to understand wikipedia editors more and better cater to their needs.[19][20] "motivations of wikipedia content contributors", a paper by heng-li yang and cheng-yu lai, hypothesised that, because contributing to wikipedia is voluntary, an individual's enjoyment of participating would be the highest motivator.[21] however, their study showed that although people might initially start editing wikipedia out of enjoyment, the most likely motivation for continuing to participate is self-concept based motivations such as "i like to share knowledge which gives me a sense of personal achievement."[21] a further study in 2014 by cheng-yu lai and heng-li yang explored the reasons why people continue editing wikipedia content. the study used authors of the english-language version of the site and received 288 valid online survey responses. their results indicated and confirmed that subjective task value, commitment, and procedural justice affected satisfaction of wikipedians; and satisfaction influenced an author's continued intention to edit wikipedia content.[22] editors of wikipedia have given personal testimonials of why they contribute to wikipedia. a theme of these testimonials is the enjoyment that editors may get from contributing to wikipedia and being part of the wikipedia community. also mentioned is the potential addictive quality of editing wikipedia. gina trapani of lifehacker said "it turns out editing an article isn't scary at all. it's easy, surprisingly satisfying and can become obsessively addictive."[23] jimmy wales has also commented on the addictive quality of wikipedia, saying "the main thing about wikipedia ... is that it's fun and addictive".[24] wikipedians sometimes award one another "barnstars" for good work. these personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a range of valued work extending beyond "simple editing" to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. the barnstar phenomenon has been analyzed by researchers seeking to determine what implications it might have for other communities engaged in some collaborations.[25] media wikipedia has spawned a number of community news publications. an online newsletter, the signpost, has been published since 10 january 2005.[26] professional cartoonist greg williams created a webcomic called wikiworld which ran in the signpost from 2006 to 2008.[27] a podcast called wikipedia weekly was active from 2006 to 2009,[28][29] while a series of conference calls titled "not the wikipedia weekly" ran from 2008 to 2009.[29] socializing offline activities are organized by the wikimedia foundation or the community of wikipedia. wikimania main article: wikimania wikimania, an annual conference for users of wikipedia and other projects operated by the wikimedia foundation wikimania is an annual international conference for users of the wiki projects operated by the wikimedia foundation (such as wikipedia and other sister projects). topics of presentations and discussions include wikimedia foundation projects, other wikis, open-source software, free knowledge and free content, and the different social and technical aspects which relate to these topics. wiknics wiknic 2011 in pittsburgh the annual great american wiknic is a social gathering that takes place in some cities of the united states each year during the summer, may be prior to the 4th of july. the wiknic concept allows wikipedians to bring together picnic food and to interact in a personal way.[30] there is also a yearly wikiconference north america. criticism main article: criticism of wikipedia ? criticism of the community wikipedia has been subject to some kinds of criticism.[31][32] for example, the seigenthaler and essjay incidents caused criticism of wikipedia's reliability and usefulness as a reference.[33][34][35] the complaints related to the community include the effects of users' anonymity, the attitudes towards newcomers, the abuse of privileges by administrators, biases in the social structure of the community, in particular, gender bias and lack of female contributors,[36] and the role of the project's co-founder jimmy wales, in the community.[37] a controversy was stirred with paid contributors to wikipedia, which prompted the wikimedia foundation to send a cease and desist letter to the wiki-pr agency.[38] wikipedia's co-founder larry sanger who later founded rival project citizendium characterized the wikipedia community in 2007 as ineffective and abusive, stating that "the community does not enforce its own rules effectively or consistently. consequently, administrators and ordinary participants alike are able essentially to act abusively with impunity, which begets a never-ending cycle of abuse."[39] oliver kamm of the times expressed skepticism toward wikipedia's reliance on consensus in forming its content: "wikipedia seeks not truth but consensus, and like an interminable political meeting the end result will be dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices."[40] recognition the wikipedia monument, by mihran hakobyan (2014), in s?ubice, poland a wikipedia monument was erected in s?ubice, poland in 2014 to honor the wikipedia community.[41] the 2015 erasmus prize was awarded to the wikipedia community for "[promoting] the dissemination of knowledge through a comprehensive and universally accessible encyclopedia. to achieve that, the initiators of wikipedia have designed a new and effective democratic platform. the prize specifically recognizes wikipedia as a community ? a shared project that involves tens of thousands of volunteers around the world."[42] see also wikipedia:administration ? an internal wikipedia page about the administrative structure of wikipedia wikipedia:the community ?
