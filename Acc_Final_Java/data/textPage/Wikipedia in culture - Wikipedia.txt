this book examining media bias, mainly about stories which do not count as news, curtis writes: "incidentally, one of the more surprising things i discovered while researching the articles for this book is that a number of them exactly mirrored a wikipedia entry on the same subject. i didn't find any exact copies of wikipedia in the articles in this book, but the structure often was the same and used the same citations in the same places. if i had to guess, i'd say that half of all the "original" articles covered in this book are wikipedia entry rewrites. if not more. it certainly makes me wonder about the rest of the articles i didn't research. wikipedia accuracy concerns aside, that's just not cool. or perhaps that's how the wikipedia articles were generated in the first place. due to the obscurity of certain details in some of the articles, and the fact that none of those details showed up in a google search on the same subject, i am more inclined to believe reporters borrow heavily from wikipedia, and not the other way around."[10] first known appearance in a book criticising the mass media, referencing wikipedia.[citation needed] apple inc. iphone in the demonstration

that everyone on the internet should be anonymous and should not be forced to give away their true identity. colbert later described wikipedia as "second life for corporations", saying if a corporation wants to pretend to be someone else online, then that is its business.[12] first nationally broadcast television program to mention wikiscanner.[citation needed] bigipedia bigipedia is a

the satirical comedy the colbert report, stephen colbert announced the neologism "wikiality", a portmanteau of the words wiki and reality, for his segment "the w?rd". colbert defined wikiality as "truth by consensus" (rather than fact), modeled after the approval-by-consensus format of wikipedia. he ironically praised wikipedia for following his philosophy of truthiness in which intuition and consensus is a better reflection of reality than fact: you see, any user can change any entry, and if enough other users agree with them, it becomes true. ... if only the entire body of human knowledge worked this way. and it can, thanks to tonight's word: wikiality. now, folks, i'm no fan of reality, and i'm no fan of encyclopedias. i've said it before. who is britannica to tell me that george washington had slaves? if i want to say he didn't, that's my right. and now, thanks to wikipedia, it's also a fact. we should apply these principles to all information. all we need to do is convince a majority of people that some factoid is true. ... what we're doing is bringing democracy to knowledge.[14] according to stephen colbert, together "we can all create a reality that we all can agree on; the reality that we just agreed on". during the segment, he joked: "i love wikipedia... any site that's got a longer entry on truthiness than on lutherans has its priorities straight." colbert also used the segment to satirize the more general issue of whether the repetition of statements in the media leads people to believe they are true. the piece was introduced with the tagline "the revolution will not be verified", referencing the lack of objective verification seen in some articles. colbert suggested that viewers change the elephant page to state that the number of african elephants has tripled in the last six months.[15] the suggestion resulted in numerous incorrect changes to wikipedia articles related to elephants and africa.[1] wikipedia administrators subsequently restricted edits to the pages by anonymous and newly created user accounts. colbert went on to type on a laptop facing away from the camera, claiming to be making the edits to the pages himself. because initial edits to wikipedia corresponding to these claimed "facts" were made by a user named stephencolbert, many believe colbert himself vandalized several wikipedia pages at the time he was encouraging other users to do the same. the account, whether it was stephen colbert himself or someone posing as him, has been blocked from wikipedia indefinitely.[16] wikipedia blocked the account for violating wikipedia's username policies (which state that using the names of celebrities as login names without permission is inappropriate), not for the vandalism, as believed. other

douglas adams. "the parallels between the hitchhiker's guide (as found in adams' original bbc radio series and novels) and wikipedia are so striking, it's a wonder that the author's rabid fans don't think he invented time travel. since its editor was perennially out to lunch, the guide was amended 'by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing.' this anonymous group effort ends up outselling encyclopedia galactica even though 'it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate.'"[103] this comparison of fictional documents in the series, is not unlike the mainstream comparisons between wikipedia and professional encyclopedias.[104] game show category[edit] the december 3, 2007 episode of jeopardy! had a category entitled "'ick'-ipedia" (a play on "wikipedia"), where all correct responses contained the letters "ick". criticism[edit] main article: criticism of wikipedia the comedy website something awful once featured wikipedia's article on knuckles the echidna as an alod (awful link of the day), satirizing the amount of detail that sometimes goes into seemingly irrelevant topics. the link description adds that the article is longer than each of the articles about echidnas, the internet, the internal combustion engine, william shakespeare and western culture.[105] the topic was also satirized in the front page, which featured a fake wikipedia style article about albert "al" calavicci from the tv series quantum leap written by something awful contributor david thorpe.[106] thorpe elsewhere linked the existence of such articles to asperger syndrome, stating "don't make fun of aspergers. if it weren't for aspergers, we wouldn't have 20-page wikipedia articles about knuckles the echidna."[107] wikipedia was also mocked in a december 4, 2006 update on something awful. the update detailed the life of a talk page on wikipedia, and mocked the neutrality, copyright, naming, quality, and personal disputes that the pages are beholden to. the update also linked wikipedia usage to asperger syndrome once more, with one fictional editor claiming to have a case of the syndrome twice as powerful as that of another fictional editor.[108] in a 2007 awful link of the day, a wikipedia article was featured again, this time on the villains of codename: kids next door. once again, it calls out the detail put onto seemingly irrelevant topics, citing a discussion in said article's talk page about the subjectiveness of the speed of certain characters. something awful founder richard kyanka then mockingly offered to write up a speed comparison of the knd characters big badolescent and cheese shogun roquefort, citing a fake episode called "episode 35, 'i am a 38-year old man with several obese cats and an empty life i futilely try to fill with childrens' cartoons'".[109] claims of negative impact of wikipedia on culture[edit] andrew keen's 2007 book the cult of the amateur: how today's internet is killing our culture asserted the proliferation of user-generated content on wikipedia obscured and devalued traditional, higher-quality information outlets.[110] see also[edit] society portal truth in numbers? everything, according to wikipedia, 2010 documentary wikipedia in the media notes[edit] ^ "loxodonta", "african forest elephant", "african bush elephant", "pachydermata", "babar the elephant", "elephant", "oregon", "george washington", "latchkey kid", "serial killer", "hitler", "the colbert report" and "stephen colbert" are/were temporarily protected.
