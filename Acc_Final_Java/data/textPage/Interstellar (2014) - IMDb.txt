at one point thorne spent two weeks talking nolan out of an idea about travelling faster than light. goofs two characters sustain a fall from an ice plateau, on a steep ice ramp, onto a shadowy ice platform. a moment later, a panoramic shot shows them fighting on a very different place. quotes cooper: we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt. crazy credits the warner bros, paramount, syncopy and legendary pictures logos are brown and dusty, representing earth's arid dry state in the film. alternate versions the 70mm imax version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, digital imax, 35mm, and digital projection versions. this is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the imax platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film. connections featured in trailer failure: interstellar (2013) soundtracks do not go gentle into that good night (uncredited) written by dylan thomas user reviews5k review top review 10/10 best movie i have seen in my life this movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. this movie was the best movie i have ever seen. i am a huge christopher nolan fan and this movie was his finest. matthew mcconaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. anne hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in les miserables, i have no idea how she didn't get an oscar for this. the visual effects were more than just oscar worthy. they were pioneering. i have never seen anything like it. one thing i would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. not like einstein stuff though. i would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a nolan fan or not. i give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100. helpful?1.4k 187 patterson13 apr 8, 2015 faq21 why did earth change its history books to claim that the apollo missions to the moon were faked? how did cooper figure out nasa's location? what were plan a and plan b? details edit release date november 7, 2014 (canada) countries of origin united states united kingdom canada official sites official facebook official site language english also known as interstellaire filming locations iceland production companies paramount pictures warner bros. legendary entertainment see more company credits at imdbpro box office edit budget $165,000,000 (estimated) gross us & canada $188,020,017 opening weekend us & canada $47,510,360 nov 9, 2014 gross worldwide $701,729,206 see detailed box office info on imdbpro technical specs edit runtime 2 hours 49 minutes sound mix datasat dolby digital imax 6-track dolby surround 7.1 aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 related news keshet international unveils new roster of format shows, foreign-language dramas (exclusive) mar 30variety film + tv hans zimmer wins oscar for ?dune? score, accepts in a bathrobe mar 28variety film + tv contribute to this page suggest an edit or add missing content imdb answers: help fill gaps in our data learn more about contributing edit page more to explore list the best movies and shows to watch in march see the full list list what's next for this year's oscar nominees? see the full list around the web powered by taboola recently viewed you have no recently viewed pages get the imdb app get the imdb app help site index imdbpro box office mojo imdb developer press room advertising jobs conditions of use privacy policy interest-based ads ? 1990-2022 by imdb.com, inc.
