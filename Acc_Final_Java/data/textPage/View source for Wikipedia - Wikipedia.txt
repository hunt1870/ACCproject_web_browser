=== restrictions ===
due to wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the english version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. for instance, on the english wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.<ref>{{srlink|wikipedia:tutorial/registration|registration notes}}</ref> on the english wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.<ref name="wp protection policy 1">{{srlink|wikipedia:protection policy|protection policy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1 = hafner |first1 = katie |title = growing wikipedia refines its 'anyone can edit' policy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/17/technology/17wiki.html |access-date = december 5, 2016 |work = the new york times |date = june 17, 2006}}</ref> a frequently vandalized article can be "semi-protected" or "extended confirmed protected", meaning that only "autoconfirmed" or "extended confirmed" editors can modify it.<ref>[[wikipedia:protection policy|english wikipedia's protection policy]]</ref> a particularly contentious article may be locked so that only [[wikipedia administrators|administrators]] can make changes.<ref>{{srlink|wikipedia:full protection|english wikipedia's full protection policy}}</ref> a 2021 article in the ''[[columbia journalism review]]'' identified wikipedia's page-protection policies as "[p]erhaps the most important" means at its disposal to "regulate its market of ideas".<ref>{{cite web|last1=harrison|first1=stephen|last2=benjakob|first2=omer|title=wikipedia is twenty. it's time to start covering it better.|date=january 14, 2021|url=https://www.cjr.org/opinion/wikipedia-is-twenty-its-time-to-start-covering-it-better.php|access-date=january 15, 2021|website=[[columbia journalism review]]|location=new york, usa|language=en}}</ref>

=== review of changes ===
although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers wikipedia provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. each article's history page links to each revision.<ref group=note>revisions with libelous content, criminal threats, or copyright infringements may be removed completely.</ref><ref name="torsten_kleinz" /> on most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. anyone can view the [[help:recent changes|latest changes]] to articles, and anyone registered may maintain a [[wiki#controlling changes|"watchlist"]] of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes. "new pages patrol" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.<ref>[[wikipedia:new pages patrol]]</ref>

in 2003, economics ph.d. student andrea ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of participating in a [[wiki]] created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored "creative construction" over "creative destruction".<ref name="fmonday collaborative effort 1">{{cite journal |last1=ciffolilli |first1=andrea |title=phantom authority, self-selective recruitment and retention of members in virtual communities: the case of wikipedia |journal=first monday |date=december 2003 |volume=8 |issue=12 |doi=10.5210/fm.v8i12.1108 |url=https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1108/1028 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206104747/https://firstmonday.org/article/view/1108/1028 |archive-date=december 6, 2016}}</ref>

=== vandalism ===
{{main|vandalism on wikipedia}}
any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that deliberately compromises wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. the most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.<ref name="upenn link spamming 1">{{cite conference |last1 = west |first1 = andrew g. |last2 = chang |first2 = jian |last3 = venkatasubramanian |first3 = krishna |last4 = sokolsky |first4 = oleg |last5 = lee |first5 = insup |title = link spamming wikipedia for profit |conference = 8th annual collaboration, electronic messaging, anti-abuse, and spam conference |pages = 152?161 |date = 2011 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=cis_papers |doi = 10.1145/2030376.2030394}}</ref> sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.<ref name="wp vandalism manipulation 1" />

=== administrators ===
editors in good standing in the community can request extra [[wikipedia:user access levels|user rights]], granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. in particular, editors can choose to run for "[[administrators (wikipedia)|adminship]]",<ref>{{srlink|wikipedia:administrators}}</ref><ref name="david_mehegan"/> which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes. administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:administrators#administrator_conduct |title = wikipedia:administrators |access-date = july 12, 2009 |date = october 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:rfa_review/reflect |title = wikipedia:rfa_review/reflect |access-date = september 24, 2009 |date = january 22, 2017}}</ref>

by 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829 |title = 3 charts that show how wikipedia is running out of admins |last = meyer |first = robinson |website = [[the atlantic]] |date = july 16, 2012 |access-date = september 2, 2012}}</ref>

=== dispute resolution ===
over time, wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,<ref group=note>see for example the [[wikipedia:biographies of living persons/noticeboard|biographies of living persons noticeboard]] or [[wikipedia:neutral point of view/noticeboard|neutral point of view noticeboard]], created to address content falling under their respective areas.</ref> seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a "request for comment".

==== arbitration committee ====
{{main|arbitration committee}}
the arbitration committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the arbitration committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,<ref name="emory disputes handled 1" /> functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. therefore, the committee does not dictate the<!-- the committee may (directly) rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may not (directly) rule that certain content is inappropriate. --> content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). its remedies<!-- although caution is no remedy, this is the language used in the reference. this could be quoted or changed. --> include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or wikipedia (16%).{{when|reason=as of when?|date=july 2021}} complete bans from wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. when conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus<!-- this needs to be clarified. anti-consensus behavior appears to be defined mostly as "edit warring". --> or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.<ref>{{cite journal |title = wikitruth through wikiorder |ssrn = 1354424 |journal = [[emory law journal]] |volume = 59 |issue = 1 |year = 2009 |pages = 151?210 |first1 = david a. |last1 = hoffman |first2 = salil k.|last2 = mehra}}</ref>

[...] the root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. there is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. namely, as a community, wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. as a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). this is one of my failures: a policy that i attempted to institute in wikipedia's first year, but for which i did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

{{anchor|decline in participation since 2007}}

the english wikipedia has {{srlink|special:statistics|{{numberofarticles}}}} articles, {{srlink|special:activeusers|{{numberofusers}}}} registered editors, and {{srlink|special:activeusers|{{numberofactiveusers}}}} active editors. an editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.

editors who fail to comply with wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. becoming a wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references".<ref name="labor squeeze on wp 1" /> editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on wikipedia,<ref name="labor squeeze on wp 1">{{cite journal |title = wikipedia's labor squeeze and its consequences |journal = journal on telecommunications and high technology law |author = goldman, eric |volume = 8}}</ref> as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation",<ref name="legal edu and wp 1">{{cite journal |title = wikipedia and the future of legal education |author = noveck, beth simone |journal = journal of legal education |volume = 57}}</ref> but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their [[ip address]]es cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.

=== studies ===
a 2007 study by researchers from [[dartmouth college]] found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to wikipedia&nbsp;... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site".<ref name="sciam good samaritans 1">{{cite news |url=https://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=good-samaritans-are-on-the-money |title = wikipedia "good samaritans" are on the money |work = scientific american |date = october 19, 2007 |access-date = december 26, 2008}}</ref> jimmy wales stated in 2009 that "[i]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users{{nbsp}}... 524 people{{nbsp}}... and in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits."<ref name="blodget" /> however, ''[[business insider]]'' editor and journalist [[henry blodget]] showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders", while most editing and formatting is done by "insiders".<ref name="blodget" />

a 2008 study found that wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,<ref name="liebertonline view on wp users 1">{{cite journal | last1 = amichai-hamburger | first1 = yair | last2 = lamdan | first2 = naama | last3 = madiel | first3 = rinat | last4 = hayat | first4 = tsahi | year = 2008| title = personality characteristics of wikipedia members | journal = cyberpsychology & behavior | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 679?681 | doi = 10.1089/cpb.2007.0225 | pmid = 18954273 }}</ref><ref name="newscientist view on wp users 1">{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126883.900-wikipedians-are-closed-and-disagreeable.html |title = wikipedians are 'closed' and 'disagreeable' |website = new scientist |access-date = july 13, 2010}} {{subscription required|s}}</ref> although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/unique-everybody-else/201303/the-misunderstood-personality-profile-wikipedia-members |title = the misunderstood personality profile of wikipedia members |website = psychologytoday.com |access-date = june 5, 2016}}</ref> according to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the wikipedia community to new content".<ref name="newscientist wp boom to bust 1">{{cite web |last = giles |first = jim |title = after the boom, is wikipedia heading for bust? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17554-after-the-boom-is-wikipedia-heading-for-bust.html |website = new scientist |date = august 4, 2009}}</ref>

=== diversity ===
several studies have shown that most wikipedia contributors are male. notably, the results of a wikimedia foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of wikipedia editors were female.<ref>{{cite news |last = cohen |first = noam |author-link=noam cohen |title = define gender gap? look up wikipedia's contributor list |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/business/media/31link.html?_r=0 |work = the new york times |access-date = october 28, 2013}}</ref> because of this, universities throughout the united states tried to encourage women to become wikipedia contributors. similarly, many of these universities, including [[yale university|yale]] and [[brown university|brown]], gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ocad-to-storm-wikipedia-this-fall-1.1412807 |title = ocad to 'storm wikipedia' this fall |work = cbc news |date = august 27, 2013 |access-date = august 21, 2014}}</ref> [[andrew lih]], a professor and scientist, wrote in ''[[the new york times]]'' that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to "ugly, intimidating behavior".<ref>dimitra kessenides (december 26, 2017).

since wikipedia is based on the [[world wide web|web]] and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the [[english wikipedia|english edition]]). these differences may lead to some conflicts over [[american and british english spelling differences|spelling differences]] (e.g. ''colour'' versus ''[[color]]'')<ref name="wp spelling mos 1">{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:manual_of_style/spelling |title = spelling |website = manual of style |publisher = wikipedia |access-date = may 19, 2007 |date = september 26, 2018}}</ref> or points of view.<ref name="wp countering bias 1">{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:wikiproject_countering_systemic_bias |title = countering systemic bias |access-date = may 19, 2007 |date = july 15, 2018}}</ref>

=== english wikipedia editor numbers ===
[[file:editors english wikipedia history.png|thumb|number of editors on the english wikipedia over time.]]

on march 1, 2014, ''[[the economist]]'', in an article titled "the future of wikipedia", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the wikimedia foundation stating that "[t]he number of editors for the english-language version has fallen by a third in seven years."<ref name="economist1">{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21597959-popular-online-encyclopedia-must-work-out-what-next-wikipeaks |title = the future of wikipedia: wikipeaks? |newspaper = the economist |date = march 1, 2014 |access-date = march 11, 2014}}</ref> the attrition rate for active editors in english wikipedia was cited by ''the economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics for wikipedia in other languages (non-english wikipedia). ''the economist'' reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. the number of active editors in english wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.

in contrast, the trend analysis published in ''the economist'' presents wikipedia in other languages (non-english wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.<ref name="economist1" /> no comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from wikipedia in other languages (non-english wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to english wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the english-language wikipedia.<ref>andrew lih.

wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. since it has [[byte#multiple-byte units|terabyte]]s of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.<ref name="wp advantages over trad media 1">{{srlink|wikipedia:paper}}</ref> the exact degree and manner of coverage on wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see [[deletionism and inclusionism in wikipedia|deletionism and inclusionism]]).<ref name="economist disagreements not uncommon">{{cite news |title = the battle for wikipedia's soul |url=https://www.economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10789354 |newspaper = the economist |date = march 6, 2008 |access-date = march 7, 2008 |issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref name="telegraph wp torn apart 1">{{cite news |title = wikipedia: an online encyclopedia torn apart |first = ian |last = douglas |work = the daily telegraph |location = london |date = november 10, 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3354752/wikipedia-an-online-encyclopedia-torn-apart.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3354752/wikipedia-an-online-encyclopedia-torn-apart.html |archive-date=2022-01-10 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date = november 23, 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref> wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. the "wikipedia is not censored" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of [[online petition on wikipedia muhammad article|images of muhammad]] in the [[english wikipedia|english edition]] of its [[muhammad]] article, citing this policy. the presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in wikipedia has led to the [[censorship of wikipedia]] by national authorities in china<ref name="taylor" /> and pakistan,<ref name="washington post state censorship 1">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/20/ar2010052005073.html |title = pakistan blocks youtube a day after shutdown of facebook over muhammad issue |first = karin |last = bruilliard |newspaper = the washington post |date = may 21, 2010 |access-date = october 24, 2011}}</ref> amongst other countries.

these numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. through its "wikipedia loves libraries" program, wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the [[new york public library for the performing arts]] to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.<ref name="nyt subjects and articles">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/theater/editing-wikipedia-at-the-new-york-public-library-for-the-performing-arts.html |title = wikipedia's deep dive into a library collection |last = petrusich |first = amanda |work = the new york times |date = october 20, 2011 |access-date = october 28, 2011}}</ref>

==== systemic biases ====
when multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, [[systemic bias]] may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. in 2011, wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example "biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare".<ref name="wiki-women">{{cite news |title = wikipedia seeks women to balance its 'geeky' editors |first = kevin |last = rawlinson |newspaper = the independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-seeks-women-to-balance-its-geeky-editors-2333605.html |date = august 8, 2011 |access-date = april 5, 2012}}</ref> the october 22, 2013, essay by tom simonite in mit's ''technology review'' titled "the decline of wikipedia" discussed the effect of systemic bias and [[criticism of wikipedia#excessive regulation|policy creep]] on the [[#english wikipedia editor numbers|downward trend in the number of editors]].<ref name="simonite-2013" />

researchers from [[washington university]] developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. the authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact.<ref>

wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content. articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as [[feces]], [[cadaver]], [[human penis]], [[vulva]], and [[nudity]]) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.

the site also includes [[sexual content]] such as images and videos of [[masturbation]] and [[ejaculation]], illustrations of [[zoophilia]], and photos from [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] films in its articles. it also has non-sexual [[child nudity|photographs of nude children]].

the wikipedia article about ''[[virgin killer]]?''a 1976 album from the [[music of germany|german]] [[rock music|rock]] [[rock band|band]] [[scorpions (band)|scorpions]]?features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked [[preadolescence#prepubescence, puberty, and age range|prepubescent]] girl. the original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. in december 2008, access to the wikipedia article ''virgin killer'' was blocked for four days by most [[internet service provider]]s in the united kingdom after the [[internet watch foundation]] (iwf) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's url to a "blacklist" it supplies to british internet service providers.<ref name="register isp censorship">{{cite news |title = brit isps censor wikipedia over 'child porn' album cover |first = cade |last = metz |work = [[the register]] |date = december 7, 2008 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/07/brit_isps_censor_wikipedia |access-date = may 10, 2009}}</ref>

== access to content ==
=== content licensing ===
when the project was started in 2001, all text in wikipedia was covered by the [[gnu free documentation license]] (gfdl), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.<ref name="wp copyright and commerciality 1">{{srlink|wikipedia:copyrights}}</ref> the gfdl was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs licensed under the gpl. this made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the gfdl requires the reprints of materials from wikipedia to come with a full copy of the gfdl text. in december 2002, the [[creative commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. the license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the web. the wikipedia project sought the switch to the creative commons.<ref name="wpf switch to cc">{{cite web |url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/resolution:license_update |title = resolution:license update |year = 2007 |first = walter |last = vermeir |publisher = wikizine |access-date = december 4, 2007}}</ref> because the two licenses, gfdl and creative commons, were incompatible, in november 2008, following the request of the project, the [[free software foundation]] (fsf) released a new version of the gfdl designed specifically to allow wikipedia to {{srlink|wikipedia:licensing update|relicense its content to cc by-sa}} by august 1, 2009.

the handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. some language editions, such as the english wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in [[copyright law of japan|japanese copyright law]]). media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. [[creative commons]]' cc by-sa) are shared across language editions via [[wikimedia commons]] repository, a project operated by the wikimedia foundation. wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.<ref name="nyt photos on wp">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/20funny.html |title = wikipedia may be a font of facts, but it's a desert for photos |date = july 19, 2009 |last = cohen |first = noam |author-link=noam cohen |work = [[the new york times]] |access-date = march 9, 2013}}</ref>

=== {{anchor|reusing wikipedia's content}}methods of access ===
because wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. the content of wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the wikipedia website.
*'''websites''': thousands of "[[mirror site]]s" exist that republish content from wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are [[reference.com]] and [[answers.com]]. another example is [[wapedia]], which began to display wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before wikipedia itself did.
*'''mobile apps''': a variety of mobile apps provide access to wikipedia on [[mobile device|hand-held device]]s, including both [[android (operating system)|android]] and [[ios]] devices (see [[wikipedia app|wikipedia apps]]). (see also [[#mobile access|mobile access]].)
*'''search engines''': some web [[search engine]]s make special use of wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include [[microsoft bing]] (via technology gained from [[powerset (company)|powerset]])<ref name="bing wp research and referencing" /> and [[duckduckgo]].

wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard [[web browser]] through a fixed [[internet access|internet connection]]. although wikipedia content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since july 2013, ''the new york times'' on february 9, 2014, quoted [[erik m?ller]], deputy director of the wikimedia foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.<ref name="small screen" /> the article in ''the new york times'' reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, "only 20 percent of the readership of the english-language wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. and the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."<ref name="small screen" /> ''the new york times'' reports that m?ller has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the wikimedia foundation. one principal concern cited by ''the new york times'' for the "worry" is for wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.<ref name="small screen" />

several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before wikipedia was founded. the first of these was the 1986 [[bbc domesday project]], which included text (entered on [[bbc micro]] computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the uk, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the uk. this was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the uk. the user interface and part of the content of the domesday project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name="domesday project" />

several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as wikipedia (e.g. [[everything2]]),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2000/tech/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |title = the next generation of online encyclopedias |last = frauenfelder |first = mark |website = cnn.com |date = november 21, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814034109/https://www.cnn.com/2000/tech/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |archive-date = august 14, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> with many later being merged into the project (e.g. [[gne (encyclopedia)|gne]]).<ref name="gnu.org">[https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html the free encyclopedia project] gnu.org ( {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64qxgzhy2?url=https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html |date=january 3, 2012}})</ref> one of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[douglas adams]] in 1999. the h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.

subsequent collaborative [[knowledge base|knowledge]] websites have drawn inspiration from wikipedia. {{citation needed span|some, such as [[susning.nu]], [[enciclopedia libre universal en espa?ol|enciclopedia libre]], [[hudong]], and [[baidu baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[conservapedia]] are not as open.|date=march 2021}} others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as ''[[encyclopedia of life]]'' and the online wiki encyclopedias ''[[scholarpedia]]'' and [[citizendium]]. the latter was started by sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to wikipedia.<ref name="orlowski18"/><ref name="jaylyman">{{cite news |first = jay |last = lyman |url=https://www.crmbuyer.com/story/53137.html |title = wikipedia co-founder planning new expert-authored site |publisher = linuxinsider |date = september 20, 2006 |access-date = june 27, 2007}}</ref>
